# Manual Audit Checklist (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)

Use this checklist to complement automated axe-core scans. Many success criteria require human judgment, assistive technology testing, or design review.

> **Important:** Automated testing catches ~30-50% of accessibility issues. This manual checklist covers what automation cannot detect.
