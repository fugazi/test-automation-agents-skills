# Bug report quality checklist

## Minimum viable bug report

- Clear title that describes the issue + location
- Repro steps that a new person can follow
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (build/app version, OS, browser/device, role/account)
- Impact and scope, plus frequency
- Severity and priority set consistently
- Evidence attached (screenshots/video/logs/trace)

## Severity vs priority (keep distinct)

- Severity: how bad the problem is for the user/system.
- Priority: how urgently to fix it given plans and constraints.

## Make reports actionable

- Reduce to the smallest reliable reproduction.
- Include any constraints (only happens on Safari, only for Admin role, only after refresh).
- Link related requirements, test cases, and recent changes if known.
