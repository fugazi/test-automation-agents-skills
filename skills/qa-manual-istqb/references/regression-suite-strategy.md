# Regression suite strategy (risk-based)

## Principles

- Optimize for risk reduction, not maximum test count.
- Keep tiers fast-to-slow; use smoke as a gating suite.
- Rebalance when product risk changes (new features, incidents, high-change areas).

## Tagging approach (Playwright-friendly)

- Put tags in test titles (e.g., `@smoke`, `@regression`) so CI can run subsets via `--grep`.
- Keep tag taxonomy small and meaningful; document it in the suite definition.

## Add/remove rules

- Add tests for:
  - Escaped defects (regression prevention)
  - High-risk areas with change
  - Critical integrations
- Remove or rewrite tests that are:
  - Duplicated coverage
  - Obsolete behavior
  - Flaky without a clear oracle

## Health metrics

- Suite duration per tier
- Flake rate (retries, non-deterministic failures)
- Defect detection effectiveness (escaped defect trends)
