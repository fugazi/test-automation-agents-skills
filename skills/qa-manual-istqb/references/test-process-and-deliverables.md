# Test process and deliverables (ISTQB-aligned, practical)

Use this as a checklist to ensure the “testware” is complete and auditable.

## 1) Test planning

- Define objectives, scope, approach, resources, schedule, risks, entry/exit criteria.
- Deliverables: test plan/strategy, risk list, reporting plan.

## 2) Test analysis

- Analyze the test basis and derive test conditions (what to test).
- Deliverables: test conditions, traceability draft, data/environment needs.

## 3) Test design

- Choose design techniques and design test cases (how to test).
- Deliverables: test cases, expected results (oracles), coverage rationale.

## 4) Test implementation

- Implement procedures/scripts and prepare test data/environments.
- Deliverables: automated scripts, suites/tags, execution instructions, seeded data.

## 5) Test execution

- Execute, log results, raise defects, re-test fixes, run regression.
- Deliverables: execution logs, evidence, defect reports, interim status.

## 6) Test completion

- Evaluate exit criteria, summarize results, archive testware, capture lessons learned.
- Deliverables: test summary report, residual risk statement, improvement actions.
