# Test Estimation (ISTQB Foundation Level)

Test estimation predicts the effort, duration, and resources needed for testing activities. Accurate estimates are crucial for planning, budgeting, and managing stakeholder expectations.

## Why Estimation Is Difficult

- Requirements evolve during the project
- Defect counts are unpredictable
- Test environments may not be available
- Team experience varies
- External dependencies introduce uncertainty

## Estimation Factors

Consider these factors when estimating test effort:

| Factor Category | Specific Factors |
|----------------|------------------|
| **Product** | Size, complexity, criticality, domain, quality requirements |
| **Process** | Test levels, test types, coverage criteria, automation degree |
| **People** | Team size, experience, skills, training needs |
| **Project** | Schedule, budget, parallel activities, dependencies |
| **Environment** | Tool availability, test data, infrastructure readiness |
| **Risk** | Technical risks, requirement stability, defect likelihood |

## Estimation Techniques

### 1. Expert Judgment / Wideband Delphi

**How it works:**
1. Present the scope to multiple experts
2. Each expert estimates independently
3. Compare estimates and discuss differences
4. Repeat until consensus is reached

**Best for:** Early estimates, unique projects, when historical data is lacking

**Tips:**
- Use 3-5 experts with diverse perspectives
- Document assumptions behind estimates
- Track actual vs. estimated for future calibration

### 2. Historical Data / Analogous Estimation

**How it works:**
1. Find similar past projects
2. Adjust for differences (size, complexity, team)
3. Use actual effort from past as baseline

**Best for:** Projects similar to past work, organizations with good metrics

**Example:**
```
Past project: 500 test cases, 200 hours execution
New project: 750 test cases (1.5x)
Estimate: 200 × 1.5 = 300 hours
Adjust for: new technology (+20%), experienced team (-10%)
Final: 300 × 1.1 = 330 hours
```

### 3. Ratio-Based Estimation

**How it works:**
- Use industry or organizational ratios
- Apply to project parameters (LOC, function points, story points)

**Common ratios (vary by context):**

| Ratio | Typical Range | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| Test effort / Dev effort | 20-50% | Varies greatly by quality needs |
| Test cases / Requirements | 3-10 per requirement | Depends on complexity |
| Execution time / Test case | 10-30 min manual | Highly variable |
| Defects found / Test hour | 0.5-2 | Depends on quality |

### 4. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

**How it works:**
1. Decompose testing into granular tasks
2. Estimate each task individually
3. Sum up all task estimates
4. Add buffer for coordination, dependencies, risks

**Test activity breakdown:**

| Activity | Sub-activities |
|----------|---------------|
| **Test Planning** | Review requirements, identify risks, write test plan, define scope |
| **Test Analysis** | Analyze test basis, identify test conditions, review coverage |
| **Test Design** | Write test cases, identify test data, create traceability |
| **Test Implementation** | Set up environment, prepare data, automate tests |
| **Test Execution** | Execute tests, log results, report defects, retest fixes |
| **Test Completion** | Evaluate exit criteria, write summary, archive testware |

**Example WBS estimate:**

| Task | Effort (hours) |
|------|---------------:|
| Test planning | 16 |
| Test analysis | 24 |
| Test case design (50 cases × 1h) | 50 |
| Test data preparation | 16 |
| Environment setup | 8 |
| Test execution (50 cases × 0.5h) | 25 |
| Defect reporting and retesting | 20 |
| Test summary and closure | 8 |
| **Subtotal** | **167** |
| Contingency (20%) | 33 |
| **Total** | **200** |

### 5. Three-Point Estimation (PERT)

**How it works:**
1. Estimate optimistic (O), most likely (M), pessimistic (P) for each task
2. Calculate expected value: E = (O + 4M + P) / 6
3. Calculate standard deviation: σ = (P - O) / 6

**Example:**

| Task | Optimistic | Most Likely | Pessimistic | Expected |
|------|:----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:--------:|
| Test design | 30h | 40h | 80h | 45h |
| Test execution | 15h | 20h | 40h | 22.5h |
| Defect handling | 10h | 20h | 50h | 23.3h |

### 6. Test Point Analysis (TPA)

**How it works:**
1. Identify test points from requirements (similar to function points)
2. Adjust for complexity, risk, and test type
3. Apply productivity factor (hours per test point)

**Simplified formula:**
```
Test Effort = Σ(Test Points × Complexity Factor) × Productivity
```

## Contingency Guidelines

| Project Characteristic | Suggested Contingency |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Well-defined, stable requirements | 10-15% |
| Moderately defined requirements | 15-25% |
| Unclear or evolving requirements | 25-40% |
| New technology or domain | 30-50% |
| Critical/regulated systems | 20-30% additional |

## Tracking and Refining Estimates

1. **Track actuals**: Record actual effort for each activity
2. **Compare regularly**: Earned Value, Burn-down charts
3. **Re-estimate**: Update estimates as scope clarifies
4. **Post-mortem**: Analyze variance and improve future estimates

**Tracking metrics:**

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Estimate accuracy | (Actual - Estimated) / Estimated × 100% | ±10-15% |
| Schedule variance | (Planned End - Actual End) / Planned Duration | Minimal |
| Scope creep | Added scope / Original scope | Tracked and accounted |

## Common Estimation Mistakes

| Mistake | Impact | Prevention |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Underestimating defect handling | 20-40% effort missed | Add explicit defect buffer |
| Ignoring environment issues | Delays and rework | Estimate setup and troubleshooting |
| Assuming ideal productivity | Overruns | Use realistic productivity factors |
| Not accounting for meetings | Lost time | Add 10-15% for coordination |
| Forgetting regression testing | Late surprises | Include in every iteration |
| Skipping contingency | No buffer for unknowns | Always add contingency |
