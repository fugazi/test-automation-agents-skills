# ISTQB Glossary (Foundation Level - Key Terms)

Essential terminology from the ISTQB Foundation Level syllabus, organized by topic.

## Testing Fundamentals

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Testing** | Process of evaluating a software product to find defects and assess quality |
| **Quality** | Degree to which a component/system meets requirements and user expectations |
| **Quality Assurance (QA)** | Process-focused activities to ensure quality is built in |
| **Quality Control (QC)** | Product-focused activities to verify quality (including testing) |
| **Defect (Bug/Fault)** | A flaw in the software that may cause incorrect behavior |
| **Failure** | Incorrect output or behavior observed during execution |
| **Error (Mistake)** | Human action that produces an incorrect result |
| **Root Cause** | Fundamental reason for the occurrence of a defect |

### Error → Defect → Failure Chain
```
Developer makes ERROR → ERROR causes DEFECT in code → DEFECT triggers FAILURE when executed
```

## Test Process

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Test basis** | Source of information for test analysis (requirements, stories, designs) |
| **Test condition** | Testable aspect derived from the test basis (what to test) |
| **Test case** | Set of preconditions, inputs, actions, and expected results |
| **Test procedure** | Sequence of actions for executing a test (how to execute) |
| **Test script** | Automated test procedure |
| **Test suite** | Set of test cases to be executed together |
| **Test run** | Execution of a test suite on a specific build/environment |
| **Testware** | All artifacts produced during testing (plans, cases, data, scripts) |

## Test Oracles

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Test oracle** | Source to determine expected results |
| **Expected result** | Predicted behavior/output defined before execution |
| **Actual result** | Observed behavior/output after execution |

**Oracle sources:** Requirements, specifications, comparable systems, user expectations, heuristics

## Test Levels

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Component testing (Unit testing)** | Testing individual units in isolation |
| **Integration testing** | Testing interactions between integrated components |
| **System testing** | Testing the complete integrated system |
| **Acceptance testing** | Testing to determine if system meets business needs |

## Test Types

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Functional testing** | Testing what the system does (behavior) |
| **Non-functional testing** | Testing how well the system performs (quality characteristics) |
| **White-box testing** | Testing based on internal structure (code) |
| **Black-box testing** | Testing based on specifications (inputs/outputs) |
| **Confirmation testing (Re-testing)** | Testing to verify a specific defect was fixed |
| **Regression testing** | Testing to detect unintended side effects of changes |

## Test Design Techniques

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Equivalence partitioning** | Dividing inputs into groups expected to behave the same |
| **Boundary value analysis** | Testing at the edges of equivalence partitions |
| **Decision table testing** | Testing combinations of conditions and their resulting actions |
| **State transition testing** | Testing based on states and transitions between them |
| **Use case testing** | Testing based on user scenarios and flows |
| **Error guessing** | Using experience to predict where defects might occur |
| **Exploratory testing** | Simultaneous test design, execution, and learning |

## Coverage

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Test coverage** | Degree to which test basis items are exercised by tests |
| **Requirements coverage** | % of requirements with associated tests |
| **Code coverage** | % of code executed by tests |
| **Statement coverage** | % of executable statements exercised |
| **Branch coverage** | % of branches (decisions) exercised |

## Test Management

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Test plan** | Document describing scope, approach, resources, and schedule |
| **Test strategy** | High-level description of test levels and approach |
| **Entry criteria** | Conditions required to start a test activity |
| **Exit criteria** | Conditions required to stop a test activity |
| **Test monitoring** | Tracking test progress against the plan |
| **Test control** | Taking corrective actions based on monitoring |

## Defect Management

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Defect report (Bug report)** | Document describing a defect with reproduction steps |
| **Severity** | Impact of the defect on the system/user |
| **Priority** | Urgency of fixing the defect |
| **Defect lifecycle** | States a defect passes through (New → Fixed → Verified → Closed) |
| **Triage** | Process of evaluating and prioritizing defects |

### Severity vs Priority

| Aspect | Severity | Priority |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Focus | Technical impact | Business urgency |
| Set by | Tester | Product owner/manager |
| Example | "Crash" = Critical severity | "Fix before launch" = P0 priority |

**Example combinations:**
- High severity, high priority: System crashes on login
- High severity, low priority: Crash on rarely-used admin page
- Low severity, high priority: Typo in company name on homepage
- Low severity, low priority: Minor UI alignment issue

## Risk

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Risk** | Possibility of a negative outcome |
| **Product risk** | Risk affecting software quality |
| **Project risk** | Risk affecting the testing project |
| **Risk level** | Likelihood x Impact |
| **Risk-based testing** | Prioritizing testing based on risk |
| **Mitigation** | Actions to reduce risk likelihood or impact |

## Static Testing

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Static testing** | Testing without executing code (reviews, static analysis) |
| **Dynamic testing** | Testing by executing code |
| **Review** | Manual examination of a work product |
| **Inspection** | Formal, systematic review with defined roles |
| **Walkthrough** | Author-led presentation and discussion |
| **Static analysis** | Tool-based examination of code without execution |

## Test Automation

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Test automation** | Using tools to control test execution |
| **Test framework** | Architecture/library for writing automated tests |
| **Test harness** | Software/tools to execute tests and capture results |
| **Keyword-driven testing** | Tests written using keywords mapped to actions |
| **Data-driven testing** | Tests that iterate over data sets |

## Independence

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Independent testing** | Testing by people not involved in development |
| **Levels of independence** | Same developer < Different developer < Different team < External team |

## Psychological Aspects

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Confirmation bias** | Tendency to interpret information to confirm existing beliefs |
| **Author bias** | Difficulty finding defects in one's own work |
