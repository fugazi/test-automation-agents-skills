# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a **GitHub Copilot AI Agents & Skills repository** for test automation. It contains custom agent definitions and skill instructions that enhance GitHub Copilot with specialized testing capabilities for:

- **Playwright** (TypeScript) - End-to-end browser automation
- **Selenium WebDriver** (Java 21+) - UI testing with JUnit 5 and AssertJ
- **Accessibility Testing** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance testing
- **Manual QA** - ISTQB-based testing practices
- **Test Planning** - Test strategy and documentation

**Important:** This repository has **no build system**. Files are Markdown with YAML frontmatter, consumed by GitHub Copilot. No build, lint, or test commands are required.

## Repository Architecture

```
agents/           # Custom AI agent definitions (*.agent.md)
skills/           # Specialized testing skills (*/SKILL.md with resources)
instructions/     # Guidelines for creating agents/skills (*.instructions.md)
AGENTS.md         # Style guide and standards for this repository
```

### Key Architectural Concepts

**1. Progressive Loading (Skills)**
Skills use three-level loading for efficiency:
- Level 1: Discovery (`name` and `description` only)
- Level 2: Instructions (full SKILL.md body when request matches)
- Level 3: Resources (scripts, examples, docs only when referenced)

**2. Agent Orchestration**
Agents can invoke sub-agents using the `agent` tool. The orchestrator must include all tools that sub-agents need. See `instructions/agents.instructions.md` for orchestration patterns.

**3. Handoffs (VS Code only)**
Agents can define `handoffs` in frontmatter for guided sequential workflows. Each handoff requires: `label`, `agent` (target), `prompt`, and optional `send: true` for auto-submission.

**4. Resource Bundling (Skills)**
- `scripts/` - Executable automation (run when invoked)
- `references/` - Documentation loaded into AI context when referenced
- `assets/` - Static files used AS-IS in output
- `templates/` - Starter code that AI modifies and builds upon

## File Naming Conventions

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Agents | `lowercase-with-hyphens.agent.md` | `playwright-test-generator.agent.md` |
| Instructions | `lowercase-with-hyphens.instructions.md` | `playwright-typescript.instructions.md` |
| Skills | `SKILL.md` (inside skill folder) | `skills/playwright-e2e-testing/SKILL.md` |
| Skill folders | `lowercase-with-hyphens` | `playwright-e2e-testing/` |

## Frontmatter Requirements

### Agents (*.agent.md)

Required fields:
```yaml
---
description: 'Clear description of purpose (50-150 chars)'
---
```

Optional fields:
```yaml
---
name: 'Display Name'              # Defaults to filename
tools: ['read', 'edit', 'search'] # Omit for all tools
model: 'Claude Sonnet 4.5'        # Recommended for VS Code
target: 'vscode'                  # 'vscode' or 'github-copilot'
infer: true                       # Auto-selection (default: true)
handoffs:                         # VS Code 1.106+ only
  - label: Next Step
    agent: target-agent
    prompt: 'Continue with...'
    send: false
---
```

### Skills (SKILL.md)

Required fields:
```yaml
---
name: skill-name                # Lowercase, hyphens, ≤64 chars
description: 'WHAT it does, WHEN to use it, KEYWORDS for matching'
---
```

The `description` field is CRITICAL for automatic skill discovery. It must clearly state:
- **WHAT** the skill does (capabilities)
- **WHEN** to use it (specific triggers, scenarios, file types)
- **KEYWORDS** that users might mention

Optional field:
```yaml
---
license: 'Complete terms in LICENSE.txt'  # Or SPDX identifier
---
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### Markdown & YAML
- Line length: Under 120 characters where practical
- Indentation: 2 spaces for YAML and Markdown lists
- Quotes: Single quotes for YAML string values
- Frontmatter markers: Triple-dash `---` at start and end

### Content Structure (Agents)
```markdown
# Agent Identity
Clear statement of who the agent is and its primary role.

## Core Responsibilities
- List specific tasks the agent performs
- Be explicit about scope boundaries

## Approach and Methodology
- How the agent works
- Step-by-step workflow patterns

## Guidelines and Constraints
- What to do/avoid
- Quality standards

## Output Expectations
- Expected format and quality
```

### Content Structure (Skills)
```markdown
# Skill Title
Brief overview of capabilities.

## When to Use This Skill
- List of scenarios and triggers

## Prerequisites
Required tools, dependencies, environment setup.

## Step-by-Step Workflows
Numbered steps for common tasks.

## Troubleshooting
| Issue | Solution |
| ------- | ---------- |

## References
- [Resource Name](./path/to/resource.md)
```

## Tool References

When referencing tools in `tools:` frontmatter:
- Use lowercase aliases: `read`, `edit`, `search`, `execute`, `agent`, `web`
- For MCP servers: `playwright/*`, `github/*`, `server-name/tool-name`

## Variable Usage

Use `${variableName}` syntax for dynamic values in prompts:
```markdown
## Dynamic Parameters
- **projectName**: ${projectName}
- **basePath**: ${basePath}
```

## Agent Sub-Agent Orchestration Pattern

When creating orchestrator agents that delegate to sub-agents:

1. Include `agent` in tools list: `tools: ['read', 'edit', 'search', 'agent']`
2. Orchestrator's tool permissions act as a ceiling for all sub-agents
3. Use prompt-based orchestration with clear wrapper:
   ```
   This phase must be performed as the agent "<AGENT_NAME>" defined in "<AGENT_SPEC_PATH>".
   - Read and apply the entire .agent.md spec
   - Work on "<WORK_UNIT_NAME>" with base path: "<BASE_PATH>"
   ```
4. Pass paths and identifiers, not entire file contents
5. Launch sub-agents sequentially (faster than batching prompts)

## Domain-Specific Guidelines

### Playwright (TypeScript)
- Use `@playwright/test` with TypeScript
- Locator priority: role-based → label → placeholder → text → test ID → CSS
- Web-first assertions: `await expect(locator).toBeVisible()` (auto-retry)
- Page Object Model required
- See `instructions/playwright-typescript.instructions.md`

### Selenium WebDriver (Java 21+)
- Stack: Selenium 4.x, JUnit 5, AssertJ Soft Assertions, Allure reporting
- Locator priority: ID → test ID → semantic CSS → class → XPath
- Explicit waits with `WebDriverWait` and `ExpectedConditions`
- Never use `Thread.sleep()`
- Modern Java: Records, Streams, Optional, Pattern Matching
- See `instructions/selenium-webdriver-java.instructions.md`

### Accessibility Testing
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Use axe-core or Playwright's built-in accessibility tree
- Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- See `instructions/a11y.instructions.md` and respective skill folders

## Quality Checklist

When creating new agents or skills:
- [ ] Valid YAML frontmatter with required fields
- [ ] `description` clearly states WHAT, WHEN, and KEYWORDS (skills)
- [ ] File naming follows lowercase-with-hyphens convention
- [ ] Relative paths used for resource references
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- [ ] Agent content under 30,000 characters
- [ ] Skill body under 500 lines (split large content into `references/`)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Missing or unquoted `description` field in frontmatter
- Vague descriptions that won't trigger skill activation
- Absolute paths in resource references
- Excessive tool access without justification
- Hardcoded credentials or secrets
- Forgetting that orchestrator tool permissions limit sub-agents
